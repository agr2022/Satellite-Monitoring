# Satellite-Monitoring

The programs here are used to autonomously monitor satellite images. For instructions on how to run the program look at the "Satellite Imagery Monitoring Documentation" file. More explainations can be found in my thesis, view the "Continous Monitoring of High Risk Disaster Areas by Applying Change Detection to Free Satellite Imagery" file. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me, Allison Roush, at agr2022@vt.edu or 571-294-5890.
